# Lightspeed API Changelog

## May 9, 2025: Fixed Pagination Method and V3 API Compatibility

### Problem Resolved
Fixed the Lightspeed sales API that was failing with a `400 Bad Request` error due to:
1. Using the deprecated `offset` parameter for pagination
2. Not formatting `load_relations` as a JSON encoded array as required by Lightspeed V3 API

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `fetchSalesData` function**:
   - Added support for a `nextUrl` parameter to use Lightspeed's recommended cursor-based pagination method
   - Removed the old offset-based pagination logic
   - Fixed the `load_relations` parameter to be properly JSON encoded as required by V3 API
   - Enhanced logging to provide more detailed information about API requests and responses

2. **Updated API response handling**:
   - Added logic to extract the "next" URL from the Lightspeed API response
   - Modified `processPageData` and `processAndReturnSalesData` functions to include the `nextUrl` in their return values
   - Updated TypeScript interfaces to include the `nextUrl` property

3. **Improved pagination flow in the main GET function**:
   - Implemented a loop that uses the next URL for subsequent page requests
   - Added more robust error handling and page tracking
   - Implemented clearer break conditions (max pages reached, no next URL, fewer items than expected)

4. **Enhanced documentation**:
   - Updated `LIGHTSPEED_SALES_API_GUIDE.md` with details about the new pagination method
   - Added a new "Pagination" section explaining how the system works
   - Updated response format documentation
   - Created a test script (`test_lightspeed_api.sh`) to help users test the API

### Benefits

- **Better Reliability**: Uses Lightspeed's recommended cursor-based pagination approach
- **V3 API Compatibility**: Properly formats parameters according to V3 API requirements
- **Future-Proof**: No longer relies on the deprecated `offset` parameter
- **More Accurate**: Better tracking of which pages have been fetched
- **Improved Documentation**: Clearer instructions for API usage
- **Enhanced Testing**: Provided test script to verify functionality

### Testing

To test the updated API:
1. Edit the `test_lightspeed_api.sh` script with your merchant ID and account ID
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x test_lightspeed_api.sh`
3. Run the script: `./test_lightspeed_api.sh`

Alternatively, use curl commands as documented in the API guide.
