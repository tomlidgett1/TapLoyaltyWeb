# Lightspeed New Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a new integration with Lightspeed Retail POS (R-Series) using OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. This integration allows merchants to connect their Lightspeed accounts to our application and synchronize data between the two platforms.

## Components Implemented

1. **Integration UI**
   - Added a new "Lightspeed New" card to the integrations page
   - Implemented connect/disconnect functionality
   - Added status indicators to show connection state

2. **OAuth Flow with PKCE**
   - Created utility functions for generating code verifiers and challenges
   - Implemented secure state management to prevent CSRF attacks
   - Added PKCE support for enhanced security against authorization code interception

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Created a token exchange endpoint at `/api/lightspeed/new`
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging
   - Added secure storage of tokens in Firestore

4. **Dashboard OAuth Callback Handler**
   - Added support for handling Lightspeed OAuth redirects
   - Implemented code verifier validation
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `LIGHTSPEED_NEW_INTEGRATION.md`
   - Added environment variables to `.env.example` and `.env.local`

## Security Features

1. **PKCE Implementation**
   - Code verifier generation with cryptographically secure randomness
   - SHA-256 hashing for code challenge generation
   - Secure storage of verifiers and challenges

2. **Token Security**
   - Tokens are never exposed to the client-side
   - Access tokens and refresh tokens are stored securely in Firestore
   - Token expiration is properly handled

3. **State Validation**
   - Random state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks
   - Validation of state parameter during OAuth callback

## Configuration

The integration uses the following credentials:

- **Client ID**: 0be25ce25b4988b26b5759aecca02248cfe561d7594edd46e7d6807c141ee72e
- **Client Secret**: 0b9c2fb76f1504ce387939066958a68cc28ec9212f571108fcbdba7b3c378f3e

These credentials are stored as environment variables:
- `LIGHTSPEED_NEW_CLIENT_ID`
- `LIGHTSPEED_NEW_CLIENT_SECRET`

## OAuth Scopes

The integration requests the following permissions:

- `employee:register`: Access to register operations
- `employee:inventory`: Access to inventory management
- `employee:customers`: Access to customer data

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Token Refresh**
   - Add functionality to automatically refresh access tokens when they expire
   - Create a background job to check token expiration and refresh as needed

2. **Add Data Synchronization**
   - Implement endpoints for fetching customer data
   - Add inventory synchronization
   - Create transaction tracking functionality

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add more detailed error messages and recovery options
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors

4. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive tests for the OAuth flow
   - Test token refresh functionality
   - Verify data synchronization accuracy
