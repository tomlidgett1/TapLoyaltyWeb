# Lightspeed New Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Lightspeed New integration connects our platform to Lightspeed Retail POS (R-Series) using their REST API. This integration enables merchants to synchronize inventory, manage customers, and track transactions between the two systems.

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

1. **Integration Card**
   - Added to the integrations page
   - Shows connection status and timestamp
   - Provides connect/disconnect functionality

2. **OAuth Flow**
   - Implemented OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication
   - Created code verifier and challenge generation functions
   - Added state parameter validation to prevent CSRF attacks
   - Stored tokens securely in Firestore
   - **Important**: The redirect URI is pre-configured in the Lightspeed Developer Portal and not sent as a parameter in the authorization request

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Created `/api/lightspeed/new` endpoint for token exchange
   - Implemented both GET and POST handlers for flexibility
   - Implemented proper error handling and validation
   - Stored connection data in Firestore under `merchants/{merchantId}/integrations/lightspeed_new`

4. **Dashboard OAuth Callback**
   - Updated dashboard page to handle Lightspeed New OAuth callbacks
   - Added validation for state parameter and code verifier
   - Implemented proper error handling and user feedback
   - Added automatic redirect back to integrations page

5. **Utility Functions**
   - Created functions for PKCE implementation:
     - `generateCodeVerifier`: Creates a random string for code verifier
     - `generateCodeChallenge`: Hashes the code verifier using SHA-256
     - `base64URLEncode`: Encodes binary data to base64url format

6. **Connection Management**
   - Added refresh functionality to check connection status
   - Implemented disconnect functionality to remove the integration
   - Added timestamp display for when the integration was connected

7. **Documentation**
   - Created `LIGHTSPEED_NEW_INTEGRATION.md` with detailed information
   - Created this summary document

## Security Measures

1. **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE**
   - Prevents authorization code interception attacks
   - Uses cryptographically secure random strings for code verifier
   - Implements SHA-256 hashing for code challenge

2. **State Parameter Validation**
   - Prevents cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
   - Uses random string stored in localStorage
   - Validates state parameter on callback

3. **Secure Token Storage**
   - Stores access and refresh tokens in Firestore
   - Never exposes tokens to client-side code
   - Includes connection timestamp for auditing

## Redirect URI Configuration

The redirect URI must be pre-configured in the Lightspeed Developer Portal. Unlike some OAuth implementations, Lightspeed does not accept the `redirect_uri` as a parameter in the authorization request. Instead, it uses the redirect URI that was registered for the application in their developer portal.

In our implementation:
- The dashboard page (`/dashboard`) is used as the redirect URI
- This page handles the OAuth callback by detecting the code and state parameters in the URL
- When the user authorizes the application, Lightspeed redirects to this URI with the format: `https://{configured_redirect_uri}?code={authorization_code}&state={state}`

## Environment Variables

The integration requires the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIGHTSPEED_NEW_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
LIGHTSPEED_NEW_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

## Next Steps

1. **Inventory Synchronization**
   - Implement periodic inventory sync from Lightspeed
   - Add manual sync option for merchants

2. **Customer Data Integration**
   - Sync customer profiles between systems
   - Match customers based on email or phone number

3. **Transaction Tracking**
   - Monitor transactions for loyalty point allocation
   - Create reports on transaction history

4. **Error Monitoring**
   - Add logging for integration errors
   - Create alerts for token expiration or failed refreshes
